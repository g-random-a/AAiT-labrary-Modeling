# AAiT Labrary Modeling 
This project is about modeling AAiT Labrary including the green area in front of it. It is intended to show the outer 3d view of our college labrary and its enviroment to people who has never been to AAit. We used Blender to create 3d representation of the labrary, then exported pointed from blender and used them in opengl to make it interactive.
